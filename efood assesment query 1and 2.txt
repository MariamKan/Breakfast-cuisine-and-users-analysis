Query#1
We notice that Volos has a better basket for all kitchens compared to breakfast and 
the frequency is slightly more increased in general for all consumers as well as consumers who have more than 3 orders.
Larissa follows the same behavior with a little lower rates for customers with more than 3 orders.
In Xanthi there is a decline in the consumer basket for breakfast and for all kitchens together however Xanthi shows better frequency for all users 
and also those who have more than 3 orders compared to the previous two cities.
Ioannina and Rhodes have a much better performance in the general basket and in the breakfast basket 
but this does not translate in the other percentages(frequency and frequency of consumers over 3 orders).
Query#2
As for the results of the top 10 users based on their orders for each city it is observed that in smaller cities (mainly in cities of Peloponnese ) 
but also in some small islands the top 10 consumers contribute a higher percentage of orders to their cities, more than 50%, but this also has to do with the fact that the orders there are a lot less than the larger cities.
